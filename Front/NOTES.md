 # KeyPoints 
 ###### (to remember) 
 ### Major Modifications 
  1. The structure has been split between the front and the server 
 2. I have written the api fonctions on api.js in the server side instead of main in the front 
 3. I have added in each app.xyz requests the const apikey that would check the key 
 4. I have created the userdb.js in the server side to store users in LocalStorage (imported with npm-LocalStorage) 
 5. I have modified the pokemonList.json to be able to access cards directly with '/' since i have now separated it and i am able to run it on a different port 
 6. ...wait for it
